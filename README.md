## Custom Joomla! Extensions

This repository contains custom extensions for the Joomla! CMS created by JoomLadds (http://joomladds.com) @ River Media (http://river-media.net)

### DOCman Majix

A Module module we created from a fork of two previous modules, combined into one for DOCman 2.0 that will create either a list of Categories or a list of Popular documents (from a list of manually entered doc ids). We created this module for a client, but will probably use it on our own site also. As simple as it is, I'm surprised that it didn't exist already (at least not that we could find)
