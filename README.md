joomla-modules
=================================

This repository contains custom modules for the Joomla! CMS created by JoomLadds @ River Media

## RM DOCman Categories

The first module we added was a DOCman 2.0 menu module that will create a list of Categories. We created this module for a client, but will probably use it on our own site also. As simple as it is, I'm surprised that it didn't exist already (at least not that we could find)

## RM DOCman Popular

The second module we added was another DOCman 2.0 menu module that will allow you to choose what documents to list (by id)
